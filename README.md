torch7-sublime
==============

Completions for using Torch7 / Lua with Sublime Text (it's an extension of the standard Lua package).

Only the most common packages have been added so far; but it's very easy to add new ones.

Supports dot completion, i.e. if you write torch. --> you can still choose between all the relevant completions in the pop-up window.
